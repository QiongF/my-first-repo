echo "I AM testING with merge and conflict in branch"
echo "I doN'T know if it detects note in bash script, let US see"

I am messing around and see if the merge and conflict will happen or not.

Note: merge function doesn't detect content within bash script (*.sh files), so far it only detect txt files.
