### Geography

I live in the city of Oslo, which is the captical of Norway.

### Hobby

- Reading. I love reading, but in the past decade I rarely read books. More often I read eBooks, but now I seriously consider reading *real books* during lockdown.
- Hiking. Norway is a great country for hiking, with amazing nature and cool weather.
- Gardening. I've just started gardening since lockdown in March, and I love watching plants, literally just watching them makes me happy already.
- Baking bread, but not cakes. I try not to eat too much sugar as I was a researcher in UiO studying metabolism.

### Food

1. I am a vegetarian, but I do know how to cook delicious meaty dishes even now I don't eat meat. 
2. Tofu and soya products are amazing.
3. Also trying to ferment tempeh at home, still optimizing conditions, wish me good luck.
4. Fermentation is great, I was successful with Szechuan pickles, sourdough bread, rice wine (maybe once?), and ginger beer is sooo good if you ignore all the afterwards farts XDDDD
